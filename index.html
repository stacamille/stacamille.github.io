        <h2>Sophomore in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a Sophomore at Bob Jones University studying creative writing. I work for the Mack Library on Bob Jones campus.</p>
         <p>
            I enjoy attending my local church: Trinity Bible Church of Greer, SC. I am really enjoying the opportunity to better my skills in writing in a godly atmostphere. I am looking forward to becoming an author of Y/A science fiction after I graduate. 
         </p> 
         <p>
            I also enjoy running and swimming. I love binge watching as well as reading a good book. On my free time, I especially enjoy grabbing a Starbucks and walking through Barnes n Noble.
